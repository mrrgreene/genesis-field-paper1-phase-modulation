\section{Computational Code and Visualization}
\label{sec:appendix_code}

All computational analyses, numerical model fittings, ripple derivations, observational validations, and graphical visualizations presented in this paper were developed using Python.

The complete, fully documented source code—including detailed replication instructions for every figure, table, and empirical result—is openly accessible at:

\end{center}

This GitHub repository contains:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Python scripts clearly organized by individual figures and analysis sections,
    \item Comprehensive README documentation for seamless setup, installation, and full replication of results,
    \item Detailed scanned derivations of all foundational and key equations,
    \item Complete datasets and parameter files used for all numerical fitting and validation routines.
\end{itemize}

By providing this structured, open-access resource, we ensure reproducibility, methodological transparency, and enable straightforward collaborative verification and theoretical advancement~\cite{genesisfield2025code}.
