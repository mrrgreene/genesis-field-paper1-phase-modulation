# Genesis Field Paper I: Phase Modulation and the Hubble Tension

This repository contains the LaTeX sources, figures, and supporting Python analysis scripts for the first paper in the Genesis Field Theory series.

**Paper I** derives a ripple structure in the cosmic expansion rate based on global coherence phase modulation and applies it to observational datasets, providing a potential resolution to the Hubble tension between local and distant measurements.

## ðŸ“š Project Structure

- `main.tex`: Main LaTeX file compiling the full paper.
- `/sections/`: Organized `.tex` files for each major section (introduction, phase derivation, application, etc.).
- `/appendix/`: Supplementary LaTeX appendices (framework diagrams, derivations, code overview).
- `/figures/`: All generated figure files (PDF, PNG) for the paper.
- `/python/`: Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for figure generation and ripple modeling.
- `/bib/`: Bibliography files for citation management.

---

## ðŸš€ Workflow

- All LaTeX editing and compiling is performed through Overleaf (connected to this GitHub repository).
- All figures are generated using Python (VS Code or Google Colab), saved locally, and version-controlled via GitHub.
- This repository provides full version control, backup, and reproducibility for scientific transparency.
