# Genesis Field Paper I: Phase Modulation and the Hubble Tension

This repository contains the LaTeX sources, figures, and supporting Python analysis scripts for the first paper in the Genesis Field Theory series. Paper I derives a ripple structure in the cosmic expansion rate based on global coherence phase modulation and applies it to observational datasets, providing a potential resolution to the Hubble tension between local and distant measurements.

## Project Structure

- `main.tex`: Main LaTeX file compiling the paper.
- `sections/`: Organized `.tex` files for each major section (introduction, phase derivation, application, etc.).
- `appendix/`: Supplementary LaTeX appendices (framework diagram, phase derivation details, etc.).
- `figures/`: All generated figure files (PDFs) for the paper.
- `python/`: Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for figure generation and ripple modeling.
- `bib/`: Bibliography files used for citation management.

## Workflow

- All LaTeX editing and compiling is done through Overleaf (connected to this GitHub repository).
- All figures are generated using Python (VS Code or Google Colab), saved locally, and pushed to GitHub.
- This repository uses GitHub for full version control and backup.
